  <p style="font-size:120%;"> The Bubble Down the Street from my House </p>
<p>
  The bubble down the street from my house. That is where you’d find me if you wanted to. Find me all the way down on court 6, rallying with some random guy that started talking with me. Find me on the hard courts running some type of drill with my coach. Find me on one of the green benches beside every court talking to friends or rehydrating after a long session of intense tennis. Find me in the lobby, contemplating on whether I should spend my $2 on a snack or a beverage. I never really make up my mind, I’m just forced to because the bell signals me to leave. I really could never leave no matter how hard I tried. There was this magnetic force that kept me there until the last minute.

  The Prospect Park Tennis Center is different from any old court in New York. It’s different from the random court, deep in Brooklyn, next to a group of latino kids playing basketball. It’s different from the massive complexes filled with 50+ courts. The Prospect Park Tennis Center was created to provide an affordable, convenient, and high quality place for people of Park Slope and New York City. T he environment never changes but the people do. I walk into the center and I know I’ll see the same thing but I don’t know what new people I’ll encounter. Kids come from all the way in the Bronx and Queens to join the tennis community. I’ve known the coaches there since my first lesson and I’ve made many lifelong friends but the cool thing about the center is that it brings in new people of different backgrounds every day. It serves as a gateway into a new hobby, and new lifestyle and I think that’s the beautiful thing about it. It creates the lifestyle of a tennis player which is quite interesting. This lifestyle causes you to only think about tennis. It’s on your mind almost all the time. After playing tennis you learn more about your true self and your inner thoughts.

  Tennis brings out the worst emotions in you at a point when you are losing. It brings out a part of you you’ve probably never seen before, and that’s what makes it interesting. There’s plenty of tennis courts scattered around New York City, whether it’s part of an organization or just some random sketchy court next to a basketball court. What makes the Prospect Park Tennis Center unique is the way it brings people of the community together under one umbrella. It provides a place where people can connect and share their thoughts and opinions with each other and feel like they can relate to one another. This place serves a similar symbol as one provided by the Nuyorican Poets Cafe. It allows people of all backgrounds to come together and have a common ground. New York changes fast and the things around the center have changed. Things come and go and so do people but the distinctive thing about the Tennis Center is that it has never changed. The same people have been there for decades, the same vending machine, the same old couch has been there as long as I can remember. I can always count that I’ll see the same thing, and I think that’s reminiscent of New York. The only thing that has changed is the more affordable price points that it provides. It allows families of lower income ,who don’t usually get the opportunity to play, to get on the court.
